* Each category now has a unique icon to simplify navigation.
* Certain recipe categories added by other mods have been merged.

I also planned to implement other improvements, but since The Indie Stone has recently been updating the crafting window more frequently, I decided against making radical changes. This is to simplify future bug fixing and extend the mod's lifespan.

# Incompatibilities
Any modifications that drastically change the crafting and/or building interface will be incompatible.

# F.A.Q
### 1. The mod doesn't show up in the mod list, is this a bug?
No, this means you have Build 41, and the mod is intended for Build 42.

### 2. Will Build 41 support be added?
No.

### 3. Is this compatible/works with [...]?
I don't know, check it yourself. And if not, report it.

### 4. Will [...] feature be added?
While I consider suggestions for improvements, I prefer to work on developing and implementing ideas independently.
